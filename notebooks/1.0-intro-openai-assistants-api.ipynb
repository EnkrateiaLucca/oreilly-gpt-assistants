    "## What is the Assistants API?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assistants API is a powerful toolkit for building AI-driven applications. It allows developers to create assistants capable of responding to user queries using **models**, **tools**, and **files**. These assistants are designed to solve problems, perform computations, and provide helpful, context-aware interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Customizable Behavior**:\n",
    "   - Define how the assistant behaves using instructions.\n",
    "   - Tailor the assistant's personality and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Integration**:\n",
    "   - Leverage built-in tools such as:\n",
    "     - **Code Interpreter**: Execute and debug Python code.\n",
    "     - **File Search**: Search through uploaded files.\n",
    "     - **Function Calling**: Integrate external tools for custom tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Persistent Conversations**:\n",
    "   - Use **Threads** to store conversations and manage context.\n",
    "   - Threads automatically truncate long histories to fit model limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Object Architecture**:\n",
    "   - **Assistant**: The core AI entity.\n",
    "   - **Thread**: A persistent conversation between a user and the assistant.\n",
    "   - **Message**: A unit of communication (text, files, etc.) in a thread.\n",
    "   - **Run**: A session where the assistant processes input and generates output."

    "2. **Thread**: A conversation session that maintains message history\n",
    "3. **Message**: Individual communications between the user and assistant\n",
