    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive guide on using OpenAI's **Responses API**, the modern replacement for the deprecated Assistants API. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build powerful AI applications that can search through documents and perform complex data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Changed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assistants API is being deprecated (sunset planned for mid-2026) in favor of the new **Responses API**, which offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simpler architecture**: No more complex thread management - just pass `previous_response_id` to continue conversations\n",
    "- **Unified experience**: Combines the best of Chat Completions and Assistants APIs\n",
    "- **Stateless design**: Instructions are stateless and apply only to the current request\n",
    "- **Better performance**: More efficient conversation management\n",
    "- **Same powerful tools**: File Search and Code Interpreter are both fully supported\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the **File Search** tool to build knowledge-based assistants\n",
    "2. Leverage the **Code Interpreter** tool for data analysis and visualization\n",
    "3. Manage vector stores for document retrieval\n",
    "4. Chain responses to maintain conversation context\n",
    "5. Combine multiple tools for powerful AI applications\n",

       "- Attention: the core idea is to let the model compute, for each position (or query), a weighted sum of (value) representations where the weights — the attention scores — come from similarity between a query and a set of keys; this lets the model directly model relationships between any two positions and replace recurrence with parallel self-attention (with scaled dot-product attention and multi‑head attention to capture multiple types of relations) .  \n",

       "1) Core idea behind attention (Transformer perspective)\n",
       "- Attention computes interactions between elements by forming queries (Q), keys (K) and values (V). For each query you compute similarity scores to all keys, normalize (softmax) to get attention weights, and take the weighted sum of the corresponding values. This produces context-aware representations that directly capture dependencies regardless of distance in the sequence .  \n",
       "- Scaled dot‑product attention and multi‑head attention: scaling stabilizes gradients for large dimensionalities; multi‑head attention runs several attention computations in parallel (different linear projections) so the model can attend to different types of relationships simultaneously .  \n",
       "- Practical payoff: replacing recurrence/convolution with self‑attention yields much more parallelizable architectures and a constant (per‑layer) number of operations to relate any two positions, which improved training speed and quality in the Transformer experiments .\n",
       "\n",
       "2) What the provided paper says about the future of agents\n",
       "- Definitions & thesis: the authors define SLMs as language models small enough to run with low-latency on common consumer devices (rough rule: models < ~10B params as of 2025) and contrast them with LLMs; they state that SLMs are the future of agentic AI because they (1) are typically powerful enough for agent tasks, (2) are operationally better suited, and (3) are much more economical, so SLM adoption is a necessary outcome if practical priorities are followed .  \n",
       "- Rationale and implications: the paper argues current practice often overuses single, large generalist LLMs to handle agents’ requests; instead, many agent requests are simple and can be handled by smaller specialized models; moving to SLMs brings advantages in deployment cost, latency, privacy (on-device inference), and energy/compute efficiency; the authors propose an algorithmic pathway to migrate agentic applications from LLMs to SLMs and present case studies estimating the potential scope of replacement .  \n",
       "- Tone: this is not a claim that LLMs will disappear — rather that for the majority of practical agent workloads the tradeoffs favor smaller, local or specialized models as the mainstream solution going forward .\n",

       "If you’d like, I can:\n",

The core methodology involves using an attention mechanism to model dependencies between words regardless of their distance in the sequence.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've learned how to use OpenAI's modern Responses API with both File Search and Code Interpreter tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Search**: Build knowledge-based assistants that can search through documents\n",
    "2. **Code Interpreter**: Perform data analysis, create visualizations, and solve complex problems\n",
    "3. **Conversation Management**: Maintain context using `previous_response_id`\n",
    "4. **Combined Tools**: Use multiple tools together for powerful applications\n",
    "5. **Best Practices**: Cost management, file handling, and resource cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with your own documents and datasets\n",
    "- Combine tools creatively for your specific use cases\n",
    "- Explore the other tools available in the Responses API (web search, etc.)\n",
    "- Build production applications with proper error handling and monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- [OpenAI Responses API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)\n",
