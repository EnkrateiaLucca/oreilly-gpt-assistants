Assistants File Search
Beta
File Search augments the Assistant with knowledge from outside its model, such as proprietary product information or documents provided by your users. OpenAI automatically parses and chunks your documents, creates and stores the embeddings, and use both vector and keyword search to retrieve relevant content to answer user queries.

Quickstart
In this example, we’ll create an assistant that can help answer questions about companies’ financial statements.

Step 1: Create a new Assistant with File Search Enabled
Create a new assistant with file_search enabled in the tools parameter of the Assistant.

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  name="Financial Analyst Assistant",
  instructions="You are an expert financial analyst. Use you knowledge base to answer questions about audited financial statements.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "file_search"}],
)
Once the file_search tool is enabled, the model decides when to retrieve content based on user messages.

Step 2: Upload files and add them to a Vector Store
To access your files, the file_search tool uses the Vector Store object.
Upload your files and create a Vector Store to contain them.
Once the Vector Store is created, you should poll its status until all files are out of the in_progress state to
ensure that all content has finished processing. The SDK provides helpers to uploading and polling in one shot.

# Create a vector store caled "Financial Statements"
vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create(name="Financial Statements")

# Ready the files for upload to OpenAI
file_paths = ["edgar/goog-10k.pdf", "edgar/brka-10k.txt"]
file_streams = [open(path, "rb") for path in file_paths]

# Use the upload and poll SDK helper to upload the files, add them to the vector store,
# and poll the status of the file batch for completion.
file_batch = client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.upload_and_poll(
  vector_store_id=vector_store.id, files=file_streams
)

# You can print the status and the file counts of the batch to see the result of this operation.
print(file_batch.status)
print(file_batch.file_counts)
Step 3: Update the assistant to use the new Vector Store
To make the files accessible to your assistant, update the assistant’s tool_resources with the new vector_store id.

assistant = client.beta.assistants.update(
  assistant_id=assistant.id,
  tool_resources={"file_search": {"vector_store_ids": [vector_store.id]}},
)
Step 4: Create a thread
You can also attach files as Message attachments on your thread. Doing so will create another vector_store associated with the thread, or, if there is already a vector store attached to this thread, attach the new files to the existing thread vector store. When you create a Run on this thread, the file search tool will query both the vector_store from your assistant and the vector_store on the thread.

In this example, the user attached a copy of Apple’s latest 10-K filing.

# Upload the user provided file to OpenAI
message_file = client.files.create(
  file=open("edgar/aapl-10k.pdf", "rb"), purpose="assistants"
)

# Create a thread and attach the file to the message
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How many shares of AAPL were outstanding at the end of of October 2023?",
      # Attach the new file to the message.
      "attachments": [
        { "file_id": message_file.id, "tools": [{"type": "file_search"}] }
      ],
    }
  ]
)

# The thread now has a vector store with that file in its tool resources.
print(thread.tool_resources.file_search)
Vector stores created using message attachments have a default expiration policy of 7 days after they were last active (defined as the last time the vector store was part of a run). This default exists to help you manage your vector storage costs. You can override these expiration policies at any time. Learn more here.

Step 5: Create a run and check the output
Now, create a Run and observe that the model uses the File Search tool to provide a response to the user’s question.

        print(f"\nassistant > {tool_call.type}\n", flush=True)

    @override
    def on_message_done(self, message) -> None:
        # print a citation to the file searched
        message_content = message.content[0].text
        annotations = message_content.annotations
        citations = []
        for index, annotation in enumerate(annotations):
            message_content.value = message_content.value.replace(
                annotation.text, f"[{index}]"
            )
            if file_citation := getattr(annotation, "file_citation", None):
                cited_file = client.files.retrieve(file_citation.file_id)
                citations.append(f"[{index}] {cited_file.filename}")

        print(message_content.value)
        print("\n".join(citations))

# Then, we use the stream SDK helper
# with the EventHandler class to create the Run
# and stream the response.

with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id,
    instructions="Please address the user as Jane Doe. The user has a premium account.",
    event_handler=EventHandler(),
) as stream:
    stream.until_done()
Your new assistant will query both attached vector stores (one containing goog-10k.pdf and brka-10k.txt, and the other containing aapl-10k.pdf) and return this result from aapl-10k.pdf.

To retrieve the contents of the file search results that were used by the model, use the include query parameter and provide a value of step_details.tool_calls[*].file_search.results[*].content in the format ?include[]=step_details.tool_calls[*].file_search.results[*].content.

How it works
The file_search tool implements several retrieval best practices out of the box to help you extract the right data from your files and augment the model’s responses. The file_search tool:

Rewrites user queries to optimize them for search.
Breaks down complex user queries into multiple searches it can run in parallel.
Runs both keyword and semantic searches across both assistant and thread vector stores.
Reranks search results to pick the most relevant ones before generating the final response.
By default, the file_search tool uses the following settings but these can be configured to suit your needs:

Chunk size: 800 tokens
Chunk overlap: 400 tokens
Embedding model: text-embedding-3-large at 256 dimensions
Maximum number of chunks added to context: 20 (could be fewer)
Ranker: auto (OpenAI will choose which ranker to use)
Score threshold: 0 minimum ranking score
Known Limitations

We have a few known limitations we're working on adding support for in the coming months:

Support for deterministic pre-search filtering using custom metadata.
Support for parsing images within documents (including images of charts, graphs, tables etc.)
Support for retrievals over structured file formats (like csv or jsonl).
Better support for summarization — the tool today is optimized for search queries.
Vector stores
Vector Store objects give the File Search tool the ability to search your files. Adding a file to a vector_store automatically parses, chunks, embeds and stores the file in a vector database that's capable of both keyword and semantic search. Each vector_store can hold up to 10,000 files. Vector stores can be attached to both Assistants and Threads. Today, you can attach at most one vector store to an assistant and at most one vector store to a thread.

Creating vector stores and adding files
You can create a vector store and add files to it in a single API call:

vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create(
  name="Product Documentation",
  file_ids=['file_1', 'file_2', 'file_3', 'file_4', 'file_5']
)
Adding files to vector stores is an async operation. To ensure the operation is complete, we recommend that you use the 'create and poll' helpers in our official SDKs. If you're not using the SDKs, you can retrieve the vector_store object and monitor its file_counts property to see the result of the file ingestion operation.

Files can also be added to a vector store after it's created by creating vector store files.

file = client.beta.vector_stores.files.create_and_poll(
  vector_store_id="vs_abc123",
  file_id="file-abc123"
)
Alternatively, you can add several files to a vector store by creating batches of up to 500 files.

batch = client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.create_and_poll(
  vector_store_id="vs_abc123",
  file_ids=['file_1', 'file_2', 'file_3', 'file_4', 'file_5']
)
Similarly, these files can be removed from a vector store by either:

Deleting the vector store file object or,
By deleting the underlying file object (which removes the file it from all vector_store and code_interpreter configurations across all assistants and threads in your organization)
The maximum file size is 512 MB. Each file should contain no more than 5,000,000 tokens per file (computed automatically when you attach a file).

File Search supports a variety of file formats including .pdf, .md, and .docx. More details on the file extensions (and their corresponding MIME-types) supported can be found in the Supported files section below.

Attaching vector stores
You can attach vector stores to your Assistant or Thread using the tool_resources parameter.

assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
  instructions="You are a helpful product support assistant and you answer questions based on the files provided to you.",
  model="gpt-4o",
  tools=[{"type": "file_search"}],
  tool_resources={
    "file_search": {
      "vector_store_ids": ["vs_1"]
    }
  }
)

thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[ { "role": "user", "content": "How do I cancel my subscription?"} ],
  tool_resources={
    "file_search": {
      "vector_store_ids": ["vs_2"]
    }
  }
)
You can also attach a vector store to Threads or Assistants after they're created by updating them with the right tool_resources.

Ensuring vector store readiness before creating runs
We highly recommend that you ensure all files in a vector_store are fully processed before you create a run. This will ensure that all the data in your vector_store is searchable. You can check for vector_store readiness by using the polling helpers in our SDKs, or by manually polling the vector_store object to ensure the status is completed.

As a fallback, we've built a 60 second maximum wait in the Run object when the thread’s vector store contains files that are still being processed. This is to ensure that any files your users upload in a thread a fully searchable before the run proceeds. This fallback wait does not apply to the assistant's vector store.

Customizing File Search settings
You can customize how the file_search tool chunks your data and how many chunks it returns to the model context.

Chunking configuration

By default, max_chunk_size_tokens is set to 800 and chunk_overlap_tokens is set to 400, meaning every file is indexed by being split up into 800-token chunks, with 400-token overlap between consecutive chunks.

You can adjust this by setting chunking_strategy when adding files to the vector store. There are certain limitations to chunking_strategy:

max_chunk_size_tokens must be between 100 and 4096 inclusive.
chunk_overlap_tokens must be non-negative and should not exceed max_chunk_size_tokens / 2.
Number of chunks

By default, the file_search tool outputs up to 20 chunks for gpt-4* and o-series models and up to 5 chunks for gpt-3.5-turbo. You can adjust this by setting file_search.max_num_results in the tool when creating the assistant or the run.

Note that the file_search tool may output fewer than this number for a myriad of reasons:

The total number of chunks is fewer than max_num_results.
The total token size of all the retrieved chunks exceeds the token "budget" assigned to the file_search tool. The file_search tool currently has a token budget of:
4,000 tokens for gpt-3.5-turbo
16,000 tokens for gpt-4* models
16,000 tokens for o-series models
Improve file search result relevance with chunk ranking
By default, the file search tool will return all search results to the model that it thinks have any level of relevance when generating a response. However, if responses are generated using content that has low relevance, it can lead to lower quality responses. You can adjust this behavior by both inspecting the file search results that are returned when generating responses, and then tuning the behavior of the file search tool's ranker to change how relevant results must be before they are used to generate a response.

Inspecting file search chunks

The first step in improving the quality of your file search results is inspecting the current behavior of your assistant. Most often, this will involve investigating responses from your assistant that are not not performing well. You can get granular information about a past run step using the REST API, specifically using the include query parameter to get the file chunks that are being used to generate results.

Include file search results in response when creating a run
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

run_step = client.beta.threads.runs.steps.retrieve(
    thread_id="thread_abc123",
    run_id="run_abc123",
    step_id="step_abc123",
    include=["step_details.tool_calls[*].file_search.results[*].content"]
)

print(run_step)
You can then log and inspect the search results used during the run step, and determine whether or not they are consistently relevant to the responses your assistant should generate.

Configure ranking options

If you have determined that your file search results are not sufficiently relevant to generate high quality responses, you can adjust the settings of the result ranker used to choose which search results should be used to generate responses. You can adjust this setting file_search.ranking_options in the tool when creating the assistant or creating the run.

The settings you can configure are:

ranker - Which ranker to use in determining which chunks to use. The available values are auto, which uses the latest available ranker, and default_2024_08_21.
score_threshold - a ranking between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being the highest ranking. A higher number will constrain the file chunks used to generate a result to only chunks with a higher possible relevance, at the cost of potentially leaving out relevant chunks.
Managing costs with expiration policies
The file_search tool uses the vector_stores object as its resource and you will be billed based on the size of the vector_store objects created. The size of the vector store object is the sum of all the parsed chunks from your files and their corresponding embeddings.

You first GB is free and beyond that, usage is billed at $0.10/GB/day of vector storage. There are no other costs associated with vector store operations.

In order to help you manage the costs associated with these vector_store objects, we have added support for expiration policies in the vector_store object. You can set these policies when creating or updating the vector_store object.

vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create_and_poll(
  name="Product Documentation",
  file_ids=['file_1', 'file_2', 'file_3', 'file_4', 'file_5'],
  expires_after={
    "anchor": "last_active_at",
    "days": 7
  }
)
Thread vector stores have default expiration policies

Vector stores created using thread helpers (like tool_resources.file_search.vector_stores in Threads or message.attachments in Messages) have a default expiration policy of 7 days after they were last active (defined as the last time the vector store was part of a run).

When a vector store expires, runs on that thread will fail. To fix this, you can simply recreate a new vector_store with the same files and reattach it to the thread.

all_files = list(client.beta.vector_stores.files.list("vs_expired"))

vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create(name="rag-store")
client.beta.threads.update(
    "thread_abc123",
    tool_resources={"file_search": {"vector_store_ids": [vector_store.id]}},
)

for file_batch in chunked(all_files, 100):
    client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.create_and_poll(
        vector_store_id=vector_store.id, file_ids=[file.id for file in file_batch]
    )
