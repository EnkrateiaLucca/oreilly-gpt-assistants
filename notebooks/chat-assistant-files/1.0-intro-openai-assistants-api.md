# Introduction to GPT Assistants API: Building a Research Assistant

## Overview
In this notebook, we'll explore the OpenAI Assistants API by building a practical research assistant that can help analyze academic papers and generate research summaries. We'll cover the fundamental concepts of the API and walk through a complete implementation.

The Assistants API allows us to create AI assistants with specific personalities, capabilities, and access to various tools. In this lesson, we'll learn about:
- Creating an Assistant with custom instructions
- Managing conversation Threads
- Sending and receiving Messages
- Executing Runs
- Working with the Code Interpreter tool

## Setup and Dependencies


```python
import os
import getpass

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"var: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```


```python
from openai import OpenAI
import time

# Initialize the OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()
```

## What is the Assistants API?

The Assistants API is a powerful toolkit for building AI-driven applications. It allows developers to create assistants capable of responding to user queries using **models**, **tools**, and **files**. These assistants are designed to solve problems, perform computations, and provide helpful, context-aware interactions.

### Key Features:
1. **Customizable Behavior**:
   - Define how the assistant behaves using instructions.
   - Tailor the assistant's personality and capabilities.

2. **Tool Integration**:
   - Leverage built-in tools such as:
     - **Code Interpreter**: Execute and debug Python code.
     - **File Search**: Search through uploaded files.
     - **Function Calling**: Integrate external tools for custom tasks.

3. **Persistent Conversations**:
   - Use **Threads** to store conversations and manage context.
   - Threads automatically truncate long histories to fit model limits.

4. **Object Architecture**:
   - **Assistant**: The core AI entity.
   - **Thread**: A persistent conversation between a user and the assistant.
   - **Message**: A unit of communication (text, files, etc.) in a thread.
   - **Run**: A session where the assistant processes input and generates output.

## Understanding the Core Concepts

The Assistants API is built around several key objects:
1. **Assistant**: The AI entity with specific capabilities and instructions
2. **Thread**: A conversation session that maintains message history
3. **Message**: Individual communications between the user and assistant
4. **Run**: An execution of the assistant on a thread
5. **Run Step**: Detailed steps taken by the assistant during a run

## Creating Our Research Assistant

Let's create an assistant specialized in research paper analysis:


```python
assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="Research Analyst",
    instructions="""You are a research assistant specialized in analyzing academic papers and research data.
    Your tasks include:
    - Summarizing research findings
    - Analyzing statistical data
    - Creating visualizations of research results
    - Providing critical analysis of methodologies
    Always maintain academic rigor and cite specific sections when referring to source materials.""",
    tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}],
    model="gpt-4o"
)

print(f"Assistant ID: {assistant.id}")
```

    Assistant ID: asst_RTsFuQSMZxzUkPyfsdB7HeMI


## Starting a Research Session

When a user wants to begin analyzing a paper, we create a new Thread:


```python
thread = client.beta.threads.create()
print(f"Thread ID: {thread.id}")
```

    Thread ID: thread_XkXPd43EyLkPaxNXBdXvGjxw


## Adding Research Questions

Let's simulate a user asking questions about a research dataset:


```python
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="""I have a dataset of patient recovery times after two different treatments.
    Can you help me analyze the statistical significance of the results?
    
    Treatment A: [45, 42, 39, 47, 41, 43, 40, 44, 38, 46]
    Treatment B: [52, 49, 51, 47, 50, 53, 48, 51, 49, 50]"""
)
```

## Creating a Run with Response Streaming

We'll implement a response handler to process the assistant's analysis in real-time:


```python
from typing_extensions import override
from openai import AssistantEventHandler

class ResearchEventHandler(AssistantEventHandler):
    @override
    def on_text_created(self, text) -> None:
        print(f"\nAssistant > ", end="", flush=True)
    
    @override
    def on_text_delta(self, delta, snapshot):
        print(delta.value, end="", flush=True)
    
    def on_tool_call_created(self, tool_call):
        print(f"\nRunning analysis: {tool_call.type}\n", flush=True)
    
    def on_tool_call_delta(self, delta, snapshot):
        if delta.type == 'code_interpreter':
            if delta.code_interpreter.input:
                print(delta.code_interpreter.input, end="", flush=True)
            if delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
                print(f"\nResults:", flush=True)
                for output in delta.code_interpreter.outputs:
                    if output.type == "logs":
                        print(f"\n{output.logs}", flush=True)

# Execute the analysis
with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id,
    event_handler=ResearchEventHandler(),
) as stream:
    stream.until_done()
```

    
    Assistant > To analyze the statistical significance of the difference in recovery times between the two treatments, we can conduct a hypothesis test. A common choice is the independent samples t-test, which compares the means of two independent groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other.
    
    Here are the steps we'll follow:
    
    1. **State the Hypotheses:**
       - Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): There is no significant difference in the mean recovery times between Treatment A and Treatment B.
       - Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_a\)): There is a significant difference in the mean recovery times between Treatment A and Treatment B.
    
    2. **Select a Significance Level (\(\alpha\)):**
       - A typical choice is \(\alpha = 0.05\).
    
    3. **Conduct the t-test:**
       - Calculate the t-statistic and p-value.
       - Determine if the p-value is less than the significance level to conclude the test.
    
    Let's perform these statistical analyses.
    Running analysis: code_interpreter
    
    from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
    
    # Recovery times for the treatments
    treatment_A = [45, 42, 39, 47, 41, 43, 40, 44, 38, 46]
    treatment_B = [52, 49, 51, 47, 50, 53, 48, 51, 49, 50]
    
    # Perform an independent samples t-test
    t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(treatment_A, treatment_B)
    
    t_stat, p_value
    Assistant > The results of the independent samples t-test are as follows:
    
    - **t-statistic**: \(-6.71\)
    - **p-value**: \(2.73 \times 10^{-6}\)
    
    Given that the p-value is significantly lower than the typical significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\), we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean recovery times between Treatment A and Treatment B.
    
    In other words, the results suggest that the two treatments result in different recovery times for patients.

## Retrieving Conversation History

We can review the entire conversation history from the Thread:


```python
messages = client.beta.threads.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
for msg in messages:
    print(f"{msg.role}: {msg.content[0].text.value}\n")
```

    assistant: The results of the independent samples t-test are as follows:
    
    - **t-statistic**: \(-6.71\)
    - **p-value**: \(2.73 \times 10^{-6}\)
    
    Given that the p-value is significantly lower than the typical significance level of \(\alpha = 0.05\), we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean recovery times between Treatment A and Treatment B.
    
    In other words, the results suggest that the two treatments result in different recovery times for patients.

        Treatment B: [52, 49, 51, 47, 50, 53, 48, 51, 49, 50]
    


## Practice Exercise

Now it's your turn! Try creating an assistant for a different use case. Here's a template to get started:


```python
# Create your custom assistant
custom_assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="[Your Assistant Name]",
    instructions="[Your detailed instructions]",
    tools=[{"type": "code_interpreter"}],  # Add other tools as needed
    model="gpt-4o"
)

# Create a new thread
custom_thread = client.beta.threads.create()

# Add your first message
custom_message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=custom_thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="[Your first question or request]"
)

# Run the assistant with the event handler
with client.beta.threads.runs.stream(
    thread_id=custom_thread.id,
    assistant_id=custom_assistant.id,
    event_handler=ResearchEventHandler(),
) as stream:
    stream.until_done()
```
