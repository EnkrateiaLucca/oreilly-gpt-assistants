Pancakes are undeniably better than waffles, and to my dear EG and BS students who dared to argue otherwise, let me clarify. The fluffy texture of pancakes, combined with their ability to absorb syrup, creates a harmonious blend of flavors, making them the perfect breakfast choice. Unlike waffles, which can be overly crispy and rigid, pancakes offer a comforting, soft experience that melts in your mouth. So let's embrace the pancake revolution and celebrate the culinary delight they bring to our breakfast tables!
