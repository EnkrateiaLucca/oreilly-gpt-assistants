Pancakes are better than waffles for several reasons. Firstly, pancakes have a fluffy texture that can be perfectly customized with ingredients like blueberries or chocolate chips, providing a delightful burst of flavor in every bite. In contrast, waffles, while crispy, often lack the same versatility in taste. Furthermore, for my dear EG and BS students who dared to claim that waffles reign supreme, it's essential to recognize that pancakes can be made into stacks, drenched in syrup, or layered with fruits, creating a more satisfying breakfast experience. Ultimately, pancakes offer infinite possibilities for creativity and enjoyment, making them the superior choice.
