# Top 10 O'Reilly Live Courses for Building Apps with AI Tools and Agents

## What is an AI Agent?
An AI agent is a software system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined rules, AI agents can adapt, learn, and respond to changing conditions. They demonstrate **interleaving thoughts (planning) and actions** - the core concept your students need to understand.

## Why These Courses Matter
These courses teach the practical implementation of AI agents, showing how they combine:
- **Planning**: How agents analyze situations and formulate strategies
- **Action**: How agents execute decisions and interact with their environment
- **Learning**: How agents improve through experience and feedback

## Key Takeaways for Your Students

### What Makes an AI Agent Different:
1. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Unlike traditional software, agents can choose their own actions
2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: Agents work toward objectives, not just process inputs
3. **Environmental Awareness**: Agents can perceive and adapt to changing conditions
4. **Tool Integration**: Modern agents can use multiple tools and APIs to accomplish tasks

### The Planning-Action Loop:
- **Observe**: Agent perceives current state
- **Plan**: Agent formulates strategy to achieve goals
- **Act**: Agent executes chosen actions
- **Learn**: Agent incorporates results into future planning

### Real-World Applications:
- Customer service automation
- Code generation and debugging
- Research and analysis
- Creative content generation
- Business process automation

These courses provide hands-on experience with the tools and frameworks that make modern AI agents possible, giving your students practical skills in building systems that can think, plan, and act autonomously.
